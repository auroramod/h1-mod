An experimental client for Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered (version `1.4.814118.0-0.32767`).  
Research for the latest Steam version of the game is on the `1.15` branch.

[This project is based on S1x.](https://github.com/XLabsProject/s1x-client)

## Compile from source

- Clone the Git repo. Do NOT download it as ZIP, that won't work.
- Update the submodules and run `premake5 vs2022` or simply use the delivered `generate.bat`.
- Build via solution file in `build\h1-mod.sln`.

### Premake arguments

| `--copy-to=PATH`            | Optional, copy the EXE to a custom folder after build, define the path here if wanted. |
